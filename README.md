## Description

This is a text-based game developed as part of the C++ Building Code Breaker Training Simulation Program for CIA Recruits assignment. The program challenges players' codebreaking skills by presenting them with scrambled keywords related to encryption and cryptography. The objective is to unscramble the keywords to progress in the game.

The game provides players with hints for each scrambled keyword, and they have the option to pass on a word if they are unable to decipher it. Players can also ask for a hint or choose to pass on a particular keyword. The game keeps track of the number of correct and wrong answers and provides statistics at the end of the simulation.

## Features

- Scrambled keywords to unscramble
- Hints available for each keyword
- Option to pass on a keyword
- Tracking of correct and wrong answers
- Simulation statistics displayed at the end
- Restart option to play again

## How to Play

1. The game presents you with scrambled keywords.
2. Try to unscramble the keyword to its original form.
3. If you're stuck, you can ask for a hint or choose to pass on the keyword.
4. Enter your guess, "hint", or "pass" as your input.
5. The game provides feedback on your guess.
6. Repeat for three keywords.
7. At the end of the simulation, statistics are displayed.
8. You can choose to play again or exit the game.

## Instructions

1. Compile and run the code using a C++ compiler.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to unscramble keywords.
3. Enter your guesses, "hint", or "pass" as needed.
4. Enjoy the challenge of breaking codes and improving your skills!

## Compilation

Compile the code using a C++ compiler. For example:

```bash
g++ code_breaker_simulator.cpp -o code_breaker_simulator
